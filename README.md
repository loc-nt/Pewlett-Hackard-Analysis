# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# CHALLENGE

The analysis's purpose is to provide lists of employees, with titles, who are ready for retirements, and who are eligible for a mentorship program and become mentors. These lists will help Pewlett Hackard to prepare for the incoming 'silver tsunami' when a huge number of employees is retiring soon and creates thousands of vacant positions to fill in.

Firstly, in order to generate the list of retirement-ready employees, I used the ERD below and figured out that I could use the Employees table and Dept_employees table to retrieve the list. All employees whose birth year are between 1952 and 1955, and who were hired between the year 1985 and 1988, are in the group of the 'silver tsunami'. Both information can be queried from the Employees table. In addition, I put another criterion, using the ‘to_date’ column in the Dept_employees table, to filter only current employees and remove anyone who are no longer working with us.  
Next, I tried to extract the title and salary information for the list. The salary data is straightforward and simple, but the titles caused an issue: one employee may have multiple titles during the time they work for us. Thus, I used the 'to_date' column to filter only the latest title that they have and ignore any older ones.  
As a result, I came up with a list of all retiring employees with their current title, beginning date of that title, and current salary. There are totally 33,118 Pewlett Hackard employees, in 7 different titles, going to retire.

The second analysis is to generate the list of current employees who are eligible to become mentors, to get ready for all newcomers replacing the 'silver tsunami' soon. The steps are very similar to the first analysis, including filtering current employees whose birth year are in 1965, together with their current title, and their beginning and ending date of that title. I noticed that since they are all current employees, their title end dates are all the same: '9999-01-01'. As a result, there are 1,549 employees eligible to become mentors based on those criteria.

According to the analysis, Pewlett Hackard needs to get ready to fill in approximately 33,118 vacant positions, in 7 different titles, when these employees retire soon. Moreover, the HR department might need to start the mentorship process for the current 1,549 employees eligible to become the mentors for all those newcomers.  
This analysis also has a limitation regarding the mentorship eligibility. Since we are not looking at the hire date for these employees, potentially some of them might just start working for us recently or might still be new to the current title and/or field, thus might not be a good fit to become a mentor. I would recommend investigate their demographic more and provide some more criteria for this mentorship program.  
In addition, the current mentor-eligibility list is in 6 different titles only while there are 7 titles having employees retiring. Fortunately, the missing title is Manager, which has only 2 retiring employees, so it should be easier to manage. Finally, the HR department might want to analyze the mentor-newcomers ratio, and come up with a consistent and efficient workload for our new mentors later.
